                  But have you ever received a handwritten thank you note or
                  letter recently? It adds a personal touch that technology
                  simply can’t reproduce. That’s because it means the sender
                  took the time to sit down, pick out their favorite pen, and
                  pull out a sheet of nice paper and write you something. Not to
                  mention everyone has their own style of handwriting so you
                  know the sender actually wrote it themselves.

                  When you get a patient testimonial and publish it on your
                  website, you’re not done. You’ll have to make them as easy to
                  find as possible. Thus, your next step is to share them across
                  your social media channels. Of course, you don’t just want to
                  share them as a screenshot. You need to keep certain design
                  aspects in mind in order to have success. Of course, you don’t
                  just want to share them as a screenshot.
